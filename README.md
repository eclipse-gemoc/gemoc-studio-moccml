MoCCML languages
====================

MoCCML, is a tool-supported meta-language dedicated to the specification of a Model of Concurrency and Communication (MoCC). 
It is made up with two sub-languages, the first one is an extensions of the Clock Constraint Specification Language (CCSL) to 
specify clock constraints based on automata and the second one is used to define a mapping between the abstract syntax of any 
language, the clocks and their constraints and the associated execution functions. 

# Development
- Continuous integration on [Eclipse CI](https://ci.eclipse.org/gemoc/job/gemoc-studio/)
- [Instructions for building](https://github.com/eclipse/gemoc-studio/tree/master/dev_support/full_compilation)
